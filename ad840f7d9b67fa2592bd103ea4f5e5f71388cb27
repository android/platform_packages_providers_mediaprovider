      "message": "I understand why you\u0027re doing this, but adding a random half-second delay doesn\u0027t seem like a very robust way of solving that problem. What if the user had a lot of data? It could take more than half a second to clean that up. Is there a better way of knowing when it\u0027s done?",

      "message": "When secondary user was deleted, Usermanagerservice send out ACTION_USER_REMOVED intent. Mountservice register the intent and remove all of user data from system.\nMountService.java removeVolumeLocked(StorageVolume volume) to do data erase.\nIdeally, MtpService should get notification from MountService and send the event to PC. Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t find good candidate and can\u0027t add new interface.\nRegarding delay time, It depend on data size.\nI have done a lot of tests \nMaximum data size is 20G, PC can get correct storage information. FYI.\nplease let me your suggestion or comment about it.",
